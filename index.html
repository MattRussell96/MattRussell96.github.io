            <strong>I have multiple interest and here are some.</strong> Growing up I never had what you would call a boring childhood always going and never stopping. Because of that I had a lot of exposure to multiple activities and a lot of opportunities for me to develop multiple interests. Some of those interests include things such as sports, technology, music, anime, and motorcycles. Ever since I can remember dating back to my childhood watching sports with my dad, playing them with him as my coach, and playing as many as I possibly could fit in to each season has led to my love of them still to this day. The same can be said about motorcycles and music as well growing up listening to the beatles, the rolling stones, CCR, the who and many more in the house or in the car has led me to branch out with one of my favorite things in life. As for the motorcycles I will never forget getting my first dirtbike at ten and my dad getting one as well and riding everywhere almost all weekends that it was warm enough to. Still to this day those are things I will bring to my son as well and pass on the tradition now. Lastly for some of my interests would be technology ever since I could barely speak I was always trying to get on the family computer and do anything I could on there even if it was typing gibberish or playing math games as I got a little older. I have always been drawn to technology learning everything I can about computers and how to work them even if for the most mundane tasks, and still to this day I still have not stopped. Just so it is in here forever immortalized anime is also a huge part as well, I could go on forever about this trust me but I am already putting any reader to sleep so I will leave it short and sweet no long winded explanation needed it is self explanatory.

                <strong>Here are some of my hobbies.</strong> Hobbies are a long list let me tell you but I promise I will spare you from all of them and just let you in on a few. To start with my earliest true hobby it would have to be skateboarding from video taping myself over and over in the middle of my mom and dad's living room just to get that one trick perfected before taking it to the streets to going to the skatepark with my friends as an adult at 2 in the morning after work just so we can get some time in to enjoy the thing we love. I will always carry a skateboard in the back of my car should any opportunity arise. Magic would consume a lot of my time as well, after I saw chris angel on tv I knew that is what I wold try to do. Many many hours of annoying my parents until they were about to pull there hair out I calmed that down quite a bit. Music was another passion of mine since I was little from listening to music with my family to playing in band, to getting my first drumsets, 4 guitars, a ukulele, and a keyboard I have been hooked and taught myself to play all those instruments through a mixture of youtube, tablature, and videogames over the years. The Last of many I will mention here is probably the biggest most impactful and prominent in my life and that would be video games. Video games have given me the escape most would love to have within the confines and the safety of my home, they have given me the tool to be and do whatever I want and whoever I could be, they have allowed me to build friendships across the world. From pokemon, halo, destiny, and any horror game I could get my hands on I would never trade it for the world.

            <strong>Here is how I got exposure to this.</strong> Throughout highschool my intentions were to take classes that had to deal with technology it could have been anything as long as it had to do with that topic even a little and they offered architecture and design which was all using autodesk's revit so I was in I mean why not. It quickly became my favorite classes I would take throughout all four years right behind another I will get to in a second. I developed a close relationship with the teacher and he would give me all the projects early and just let me get them done because he knew I excelled at it so much so that me and two other classmates were also offered up to go make a full recreation of the seventh day adventist school buildings for the local police to do virtual training and route planning in the event of something unfortunate. Then came my senior year and they offered a new class video game design and of course I jumped on that, why not I mean my favorite teacher, having him two periods in a row, and video games I mean why not so I took it. The issue here was that it was just as new to us as it was to the teacher so teaching wasn't the greatest but my friends and I got a group together and prevailed being asked to compete in Indianapolis for a competition for junior level designers and he thought it was a good idea. Unfortunately that got squashed due to nerves and us not really comprehending and understanding what we were doing fully, because of the major challenge it was I didn't really give it any thought from there on out and let it die moving on.

            <strong>Crazy things happened rapidly to get me to this point in my life.</strong> After my unfortunate experience and possibly ruining of anything coding wise I figured my dream was dead and fell back on to architecture and design my second love for my college path as soon as I graduated. I went to ivy tech my first year outside of highschool for my pre requisites and while I was in english class I noticed the computers were loaded with revit the architecture and design software so believe it that I started messing around with it once again. The second year I went and told them I wanted to utilize that software and go for architecture and design and as the first day of class started I was downloading a different software and was put in an engineering class online and struggled. I ended up not going back feeling I wasted this time and got a job at Family Leisure where I worked there for 6.5 years until this past january 2022 my brother in-law was asking me why i never got into this field and to which I just replied it wasn't for me not knowing that I just hadn't learned it properly. He has been in the industry for 6 years and introduced me to boot camps and how well they can get someone prepared if they are willing to work for it. It also turned out that I know a few people who have been through them and or are currently enrolled and talking with everyone gave me the courage to pursue a dream of mine that I once believed was unattainable now here I am ready to start a new chapter in my life and I couldn't be happier!
